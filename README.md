# Task description

In this task we will perform sequence classification. We will categorize temporally coherent and uniformly distributed short sections of a long time-series. In particular, for each 4 seconds of a lengthy EEG/EMG measurement of brain activity recorded during sleep, we will assign one of the 3 classes corresponding to the sleep stage present within the evaluated epoch.
